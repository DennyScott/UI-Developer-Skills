#UI Developer Skills

##Frameworks

###Angular - MV* Framework to build mobile apps with

###Famous - View Framework to help build apps with. We use this to build native-like animations. Uses Matrix3D transformation, so the elements on the page are GPU(hardware)-Accelerated. Furthermore, famous renders the dom itself through its own engine. This means we don't have to use JQuery to query the DOM, we already have the items in Javascript.

###Ionic - Framework built with Angular JS. Similar to bootstrap functionality, but written in the "Angular" way, using Directives and allowing for more semantic (declaritive) html.

###Bootstrap - Sometimes we use it. A front-end framework used for styling.

###Backbone - Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API.

##Build Tools

### Gulp: Gulp is a fast and intuitive streaming build tool built on Node.js. It's used for building tasks, such as building, minification, testing, etc. Gulp uses Javascript, allowing functions for tasks.

### Grunt - Similar to Gulp, but uses Object notation.

### Lineman - is a command-line utility that is hyper-focused on helping web developers build first-class JavaScript web applications. Dependent on Grunt.


## Package Management Systems

### Bower - Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.

### NPM - npm is a package manager for JavaScript, and is default for Node.js.

### Yeoman - Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive. Allows us to Scaffold Projects.

## Mobile Deployment

### Cordova - Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript

### Cocoon JS - For our purposes, allows us to wrap a newer browser dependency with apps then Cordova. This will speed up our app under the hood, since the newer browsers generally allow faster compiling.

### Phonegap - Cordova, but owned by Adobe. Has some streamlining.


## Front-End Libraries

### Lo Dash / Underscore - A utility library delivering consistency, customization, performance, & extras.

### JQuery - We don't use this too much, as parsing dom is expensive on mobile, regardless, it's still very important to know. a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML

### Parse - add a powerful core, push notifications, and analytics to your app with Parse. 


## Testing Libraries

### Karma - A simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple real browsers. Used as a test runner for our Jasmine tests.

### Jasmine - Behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript framework. It does not require a DOM.

## Style Frameworks

### SASS - Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.

### LESS - Less extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.

## Backend Systems

### Node JS - Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.

### Express - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework

### Sails - Sails.js make it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to mimic the MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails

### Rails - Rails is a full-stack framework that emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), the active record pattern, and model–view–controller (MVC).


## Database
### Mongo DB - an open-source document database, and the leading NoSQL database.
### My SQL - SQL Database. Most Popular.


## Game Engines
### Unity - Unity is a cross-platform game creation system developed by Unity Technologies, including a game engine and integrated development environment (IDE). It is used to develop video games for web sites, desktop platforms, consoles, and mobile devices.

### Phaser - A free, fast and flexible framework for HTML5 game creation. Uses Web GL with a Canvas Fallback. Basically a Game Engine built on top of Pixi JS.

### Pixi JS - The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. The Pixi renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of webGL. Also, it's fast.

### CreateJS - Canvas Html5 Hame Engine.
